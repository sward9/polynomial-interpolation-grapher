# Math 351 Final Project (polynomial interpolation grapher), by Simon Ward#
### Note: ### This is the code repository, but the program should be downloaded for use at:

This program, created for the final project of Fall Semester Math 351 at University of Oregon, is a polynomial interpolation grapher.
It allows the user to enter (x,y) coordinate pairs, and creates an interpolation graph based on the coordinates the user has given.
The interpolation method used is Lagrange interpolation.
